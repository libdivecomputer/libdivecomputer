Version 0.3.0 (2013-02-06)
==========================

The v0.3.0 release introduces some interesting features for technical divers,
support for a number of new devices and many smaller bugfixes.

There have been a few minor changes to the public interface, to remove a few
deprecated functions. Therefore this release is not completely backwards
compatible with the previous release. However, most applications won't be
affected by these changes.

 * Add support for setpoint, ppO2 and CNS
 * Add support for salinity and atmospheric pressure
 * Add a new gaschange2 event with O2 and He percentages.
 * Add a new vendor event.
 * Add some missing size macros.
 * Add timestamps to the default log function.
 * Include the git commit SHA1 in the version number.

Removed/changed features:

 * Remove the suunto_vyper_device_set_delay function.
 * Remove the reefnet_sensusultra_device_set_maxretries function.
 * Remove the xxx_device_set_timestamp functions.
 * Remove the uwatec_smart_device_version function.
 * Remove the dc_device_version function.
 * Remove the page, packet and memory size macros from the public api.
 * Add a model parameter to the mares_iconhd_device_open function.

Version 0.2.0 (2012-09-21)
==========================

The v0.2.0 release marks the first step towards a redesign of the public
interface. The major highlights of this release are the introduction of
a namespace prefix, the device enumeration support, and a much more
flexible logging system.

Please note that the public interface has changed significantly, and
therefore this release is NOT backwards compatible with the previous
release. Applications will have to be updated to support the new
features!

New features:

 * Add support for the Heinrichs Weikamp Frog.
 * Separate private and public headers.
 * Use common status codes for the device and parser layers.
 * Use a common backend type for the device and parser layers.
 * Introduce a namespace prefix for the high-level public api.
 * Add the device enumeration support.
 * Add a dc_device_open convenience function.
 * Add a dc_parser_new convenience function.
 * Add a new library context object.
 * Add support for an application defined logging function.
 * Add an option to disable the logging.
 * Add an option to enable support for pseudo terminals.

Bug fixes:

 * [d9] Enable the model hint to speedup the autodetection.
 * [ostc] Add support for eeprom bank number 2.
 * [iconhd] Fix the detection of the last dive.
 * [d9] Fix the profile ringbuffer end.
 * [misc] Fix a build error with automake 1.12 or newer.
 * [serial] Fix some ioctl calls on 64bit Mac OS X.
 * [cobalt] Fix the libusb timeout handling.
 * [atom2] Add support for the Aeris Manta.
 * [irda] Remove the IrDA init and cleanup functions.
 * [serial] Enable exclusive access mode.
 * [atom2] Add support for the Oceanic OCS.
 * [frog] Finish immediately if there are no dives available.
 * [frog] Verify the header in the logbook and profile are identical.
 * [atom2] Fixed date parsing for Oceanic VEO 3.0
 * [smart] Add support for the Uwatec Galileo Trimix.
 * [vyper] Don't exceed the maximum number of bytes.
 * [d9] Fix the gas mix parsing.

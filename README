Overview
========

Libdivecomputer is a cross-platform and open source library for
communication with dive computers from various manufacturers.

The official web site is:

  http://www.libdivecomputer.org/

The sourceforge project page is:

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/libdivecomputer/

Installation
============

On UNIX-like systems (including Linux, Mac OS X, MinGW), use the
autotools based build system. Run the following commands from the top
directory (containing this file) to configure, build and install the
library and utilities:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make install

If you downloaded the libdivecomputer source code directly from the git
source code repository, then you need to create the configure script as
the first step:

  $ autoreconf --install

To uninstall libdivecomputer again, run:

  $ make uninstall

Docker Usage
============

This project provides a Dockerfile to create a consistent and isolated environment for both building and running the `libdivecomputer` tools.

To build the Docker image:

  $ docker build -t libdivecomputer .

To run a `libdivecomputer` command and interact with a dive computer (e.g., downloading data from a Suunto Cobra 3 via a serial device):

  $ docker run --rm -it \
    --device /dev/ttyUSB0 \
    -v $(pwd):/out \
    libdivecomputer \
    download -t serial -f XML -o cobra3.xml suunto_cobra3

*Note: Replace `/dev/ttyUSB0` with the actual path to your dive computer device (e.g., `/dev/ttyUSB0` for a serial device or `/dev/bus/usb/001/002` for a usb device). The `-v $(pwd):/out` mounts your current directory into the container, allowing output files (like `cobra3.xml`) to be saved to your host machine.*
